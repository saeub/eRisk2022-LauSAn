I get really angry like a spike of emotion, then I get angry and sad at myself for being so petty\", \"I barely stop myself, but whenever something annoys me I think of the most hurtful comment that I could possibly say to them, and for that split second I feel that I am completely justified to say that. But even when someone is saying nothing I feel like they are silently judging me somehow. I know it's crazy but nothing helps me from thinking that the world is against me or something (not meant to sound as melodramatic but I can't think of a better way to explain)\", \"I'm really glad I'm not alone, I even get self-conscious around the person I've been dating for a year and a bit.

However, recently (and I think it\\'s due to the meds I\\'m on) I had a really bad breakdown right in front of my boyfriend. I know I didn\\'t make sense but I couldn\\'t stop crying. At that moment in time I really wanted the whole world to just end. But what hurt me the most is that he started yelling at me too, and kept on saying \"I don\\'t understand you\" and \"What do you want from me\" and \"I give up\". I was on the floor and he was all the way across the room. At that moment I wanted him to just be close to me and maybe let me know I wasn\\'t completely alone. I realize now that this is just me wanting something and not considering what the other person is feeling, but now I don\\'t know how to face him. One, because I am completely mortified by how much I cried and babbled. Two, because I can\\'t help but feel hurt by how he got angry at me, even though on multiple occasions I have tried to tell him what is wrong with me, and what happens to me recently. He always avoids conversation about my depression, saying \"don\\'t think about it, if you think about it, it won\\'t go away\". I know it\\'s probably annoying to hear someone talk about being depressed, but I thought he would at least try for me (we have been going out for some time). I don\\'t know what to do, please help me out.', \"Hi, I just want you to know that you're not alone, I have panic attacks too and I have no way of controlling them. Especially recently. You can't stop crying, you can't stand, you can't breathe. It's terrifying, but you are definitely not alone, hopefully we can find ways of coping\", \"It's kind of strange, you said most of what has been going on in my head, and a lot of our situations are similar. It's really frustrating and you want it to all go away, but it won't. I don't know how to cope with my problems yet, so I can't give any advice, but one of the main problems I have is that I feel completely alone. So just to let you know, you are not alone, because there are other people who feel the same way\", \"I've thought about that. The word abuse has sprung up a couple of times in my meetings with my councilor. They are convinced that I am verbally abused, I just deny it. I also see myself defending him a lot. For instance, he does have a mood disorder that I knew of previous to my situation, and I was not making sense even to myself. I'm going to sound like an idiot so spare me, but I really like him. He is usually warm and charming, just recently not so much. Which is probably why the situation hurt me more. If I could stop liking him I would, but for me that's really hard\", 'Thanks so much for your reply. My boyfriend actually has a mood disorder, and to his defense I think he was in his bad mood swings. However, I also feel that I have explained what I want when I am feeling like this to him before hand. Do you think he is just getting tired and annoyed of me and my depression?

But what hurt me the most is that he started yelling at me too, and kept on saying \"I don\\'t understand you\" and \"What do you want from me\" and \"I give up\". I was on the floor and he was all the way across the room. At that moment I wanted him to just be close to me and maybe let me know I wasn\\'t completely alone. I realize now that this is just me wanting something and not considering what the other person is feeling, but now I don\\'t know how to face him. One, because I am completely mortified by how much I cried and babbled. Two, because I can\\'t help but feel hurt by how he got angry at me, even though on multiple occasions I have tried to tell him what is wrong with me, and what happens to me recently. He always avoids conversation about my depression, saying \"don\\'t think about it, if you think about it, it won\\'t go away\". I know it\\'s probably annoying to hear someone talk about being depressed, but I thought he would at least try for me (we have been going out for some time). I don\\'t know what to do, please help me out. Let\\'s hope that never happens. But sometimes I can\\'t help but think that they will be so much better off without me, and they know that they would be happier without me. I don\\'t want them to leave but, sometimes I wonder if they want to leave but they are just too nice to. I\\'m really glad I\\'m not alone, I even get self-conscious around the person I\\'ve been dating for a year and a bit. I get really nervous that my depression will drive them away',\n",

I'm going to sound like an idiot so spare me, but I really like him. He is usually warm and charming, just recently not so much. Which is probably why the situation hurt me more.

It's really frustrating and you want it to all go away, but it won't. I don't know how to cope with my problems yet, so I can't give any advice, but one of the main problems I have is that I feel completely alone. So just to let you know, you are not alone, because there are other people who feel the same way Hi, I just want you to know that you're not alone, I have panic attacks too and I have no way of controlling them.

I assume I entered the dream state at some point while the buzzing was going on because all at once the buzzing stopped and I was floating off of my bed, toward the ceiling. I know it wasn\\'t an OBE because I looked down at the bed and my body wasn\\'t there. I floated until I bumped into the ceiling. I was terrified and mustered all of my strength and screamed, which took me out of the dream. My roommate later told me that he\\'d heard me scream. I was so scared by what had happened that I couldn\\'t sleep the rest of the night. Instead, I stayed up and researched as much as I could about lucid dreaming.\\n\\nI was afraid to have another one through the following nights, but enough time passed that I stopped worrying about it, and I wrote it off as a one-time freak occurrence.\\n\\nUntil last night. I was drifting off and felt the buzzing again. Instead of being scared I tried to focus on it. Next I knew, I was floating around and out of my (closed) bedroom window. I dreamed I was exploring a little historical town. I was playing around with running and floating, and just controlling myself in general. The dream was so vivid. Normal dreams for me are blurry, or hazy, but this one was crystal clear, like I was really there on a bright sunny day. I could look around and go where I wanted. It was devoid of other people tho, or any action.

After that didn't work, ENT told me I would just have to live with it.

At my follow-up yesterday he has now told me there's nothing else to be done. He says sometimes the nerves send a signal of fullness to the brain so that it feels congested when it's really not.

In social animals, it also includes the raising of their offspring. Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. The two individuals may be of opposite sexes or hermaphroditic, as is the case with, for example, snails.\\nFor animals, mating methods include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes such behaviours as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating domesticated animals and of artificially inseminating them is part of animal husbandry.\\n\\n In some terrestrial arthropods, including insects representing basal (primitive) phylogenetic clades, the male deposits spermatozoa on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure. Courtship involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. In groups such as dragonflies and many spiders, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified sternites on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male pedipalps). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its aedeagus, a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a \"spermatophore\") into the female\\'s reproductive tract.\\nOther animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many basal vertebrates. Vertebrates (such as reptiles, some fish, and most birds) reproduce with internal fertilization through cloacal copulation (see also hemipenis), while mammals copulate vaginally.\\n\\nAnd then there was a very long list of things like \"horses breeding hard\" and \"dog breeding videos up close\" which I can only assume were meant to be keywords and hopefully not insight into the sexual preferences of whomever posted the video.',\n",

After that didn't work, ENT told me I would just have to live with it.

At my follow-up yesterday he has now told me there's nothing else to be done. He says sometimes the nerves send a signal of fullness to the brain so that it feels congested when it's really not.

It's not supposed to snow in March.)\\n\\nAnyway, I probably had a very different graduate school experience than you are having, but let me tell you about what I do. During my undergraduate time I started working with my advisor (academic) and told him I was more interested in working in industry than academia. I continued to work for him as an undergraduate for about 2 years before getting my BS. I was planning to go to graduate school. That was always part of the plan.\\n\\nThe work I ended up doing in his lab my senior year ended up carrying into my graduate degree and that helped me get through it a little quicker. My first year I had some crazy hours. Shitty pay, that never improved. One calendar year I received a full graduate student in engineering stipend. After that year, I settled into a rhythm a bit and got started on a new project. Which was good, as I was over the one that had carried on from undergrad.\\n\\nAfter about 2 years on that project I was fucking done with it too. It was going nowhere. Another guy in my lab had been working on something similar for about a year before I started and his seemed to work better (from a fundamentals thing as I was working the alternative design). Finally we got enough data (we thought) to publish mine and that would represent my 3rd paper (I'm leaving one out because it was a side project that ended up working really well.) My committee decided I should graduate in the middle of June and I defended at the end of July. July sucked. A lot. All during this my advisor was very results oriented. He knew we got paid for 20 hours. He didn't care if it took us 10 hours a week of work to get something done if the results were real and what we were hoping for. Sitting around reading meaningless papers is a waste of time\\n\\nI eventually found a job while working on some random stuff in my lab and helping them move from one building to the next. I was lucky, my advisor was willing and able to pay me.\\n\\nThe new job, me in a totally different climate, going from hot as balls to cold as fuck has been very different for me. There still are proposals, but your role in that can be as much or as little in the writing process as you want. Backing up a little, I work for a small company now that relies largely on SBIR grants and that sort of thing. The goal is to use one or more of these to get something that works to market and sell infinity and drop the mic. It scares me a little (scared me moving 1800 miles) but they're attached to a slightly larger company that's been more stable as they've been around for 30+ years. Now, at my new company, I'm expected to work 40 hours per week. Not 9-5 or whatever, just 2 weeks that average 40 hours. I have a ton of flexibility with my schedule. Meetings are expensive, especially when there are 7 PhDs present.\\n\\nA few things to keep in mind:\\nYour advisor sounds crazy. I have a friend in BME who has an advisor a bit like yours (mostly with the random fucking e-mails). Basically you have to get across to him that you plan to do what he asks, in a reasonable time frame. Him expecting you to have work done at 11 that he asked about at 9 on a Sunday is not a reasonable time frame. If it were a weekday, sure, maybe.\\n2-3 meetings a day is incredibly inefficient. Do everything you can to cut that back to like once per week for 2 hours if necessary.\\nWhy do you feel the need to keep the same hours as him? He gets paid a lot more than you do. You get paid for 20 hours/week (usually). Keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that you need to get your work done to graduate, BUT without killing/burning yourself out.\\nIn my experiences working with PhDs from industry (we got more industry backed funding than anything else), you get a bit of both worlds. You have some who absolutely dont take their work home and some who obsess over it. Both are successful.\\n\\nTL;DR: Post academia can be pretty much what you want it. I had a reasonable advisor and managed to find a job that gives me flexible scheduling. Your advisors an asshat who doesnt know how to manage people. \\n\\nStart looking for a job now. Dont necessarily tell him cause he might freak out\",\n",

There show would have compelling personal drama and an emphasis on hard, science-based SF.\\n\\nWhat we got was, more often than not, a muddled mess with terrible dialogue, lazy plotting, poor acting, cheap-looking sets and a giant helping of sledgehammer o\\' message on a regular basis.\\n\\nOne thing people may not know is that not only did Straczynski create and run the show, he wrote 92 of the 110 episodes of the show.Apparently, even the 18 episodes that were done by other writers were extensively re-written by him. There\\'s a good reason why that kind of thing isn\\'t done.  Nobody can  produce content at that rate (and run the show too) and maintain any kind of quality.  \\n\\nThere\\'s a great quote from, often attributed to Mark Twain but actually penned by Edgar Wilson Nye, \"Wagner\\'s music is better than it sounds\". \\n\\nThis kind of sums up my opinion of B5. When I watched the show back in the day, I was often unhappy with what wss on the screen, but there were hints and shadows of great things just around the corner. There was, I think, a much better show hidden inside, but Stracznski\\'s limitations and his control freak nature basically smothered it.\\n\\nWhat\\'s interesting, looking back, is that B5 was in many ways a prototype for modern, serialized, mystery-driven, genre TV shows like Lost, Battlestar Galactica, etc.',\n",

It's a two story house, 1400 sq ft house with a single zone and 13 cast-iron radiators for hot water heat.\\n\\nWhen we bought the house in 2010, one of the first things I had done was to replace the old, oil-fired burner and cheap , gas hot water heater with a new Burnham Alpine Condensing Boiler and a Buderus S120w indirect hot water heater.\\n\\nNow when the system works, it's great. The house stays nice and warm in the winter and my gas bills are low.\\n\\nThe problem is that during the transition from heating season to non-heating season and also from summer into heating season, I get a lot of air in the hot water system. The system gets air bound and I have to turn the system off, close a valve and open the water spigot and let water run through a hose into a bucket until all the air is out.\\n\\nThis obviously creates several problems. One, I have no hot water. Two, the circulator runs and runs until I fix it, which can't be good for it and third, when It's cold out I have no heat because the burner is programmed to heat the hot water before it heats the house.\\n\\nThe guys who installed the system don't seem to have a good solution for me. The added an air eliminator right above the hot water circulator, but that didn't seem to help.\\n\\nThe system was fine all summer, but then it got a bit chilly, the heat kicked on and now I'm down in the basement bleeding the system on a daily basis.\\n\\nToday I tried running the heat and then opening the bleeder valves on the radiators to try and clean out some of the air. No joy there. The problem remains.\\n\\nIf anyone has any idea of how to either\\n\\n1)    Keep the air from getting into my system or\\n2)    Have it be automatically eliminated or other wise dealt with\\n\\nI'd appreciate it\",\n",
